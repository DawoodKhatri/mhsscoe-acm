They were given one hour to solve the two problems in each round. The questions were designed to challenge the students and promote out of the box thinking, problem solving skills and analytical thinking. Numerous students turned up from second year, third year and fourth year as well.",

At 10:20 am, the round one officially began and the students began coding. It included questions like finding the sum of N numbers and printing a star pattern of user inputted lines. The students had a mixed emotion of being shocked and amused when they found out that round 1 was to blind code i.e., they cannot look at the keyboard as they type. Thirty students from the list that had the fastest performance and successfully finished both codes proceeded to round 2.",

It began at 11:20 and students breathed a sigh of relief when they found out they can see their keyboards while typing this time. The questions in this round included finding sum of digits in a number till it becomes a single digit and replacing each element in the array by its rank in it. This round lasted 45 minutes and concluded thereafter. Only 10 students qualified to the final round.",
